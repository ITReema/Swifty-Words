# Swifty Words
A word game based on the popular indie game 7 Little Words. Users are going to see a list of hints and an array of buttons with different letters on, and need to use those buttons to enter words matching the hints.

## Challenge
1. Draw a thin gray line around the buttons view, to make it stand out from the rest of the UI.
2. If the user enters an incorrect guess, show an alert telling them they are wrong.
3. Try making the game also deduct points if the player makes an incorrect guess.
